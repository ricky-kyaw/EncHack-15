> A unified loyalty and discount miniapp built on the Luffa SuperBox platform.
> Built at Encode Hackathon 2025 by Team Fuzzy.

## What It Does

Luffa Passport is a super-wallet for loyalty cards. Instead of juggling separate apps
for every coffee shop, restaurant, and membership scheme, users store all their cards
in one place. Tapping a card instantly surfaces all deals, discounts, and rewards
available for that card — personalised, contextual, and instant.

Built for everyone, starting with local merchants:
- 🍽️ KU Eat Central (campus canteen)
- ☕ Nino Cafe (Fairfield Park)
- 🥙 Cappadocia Kingston (student favourite)
- ⬡ Luffa Wallet (Web3 / crypto card)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend — Luffa SuperBox Miniapp
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **WXML** | Markup language for miniapp UI. Similar to HTML but with WeChat/Luffa-specific components like `<scroll-view>`, `<view>`, `<text>`. Supports data binding via `{{}}` syntax. |
| **WXSS** | Stylesheet language for miniapp. CSS subset with `rpx` units (responsive pixels that scale to screen width). No external fonts or backdrop-filter support. |
| **JavaScript** | Page logic, lifecycle hooks (`onLoad`, `onShow`), and API calls via `wx.request()`. |
| **wx.setStorageSync** | Luffa/WeChat's built-in local storage API. Used to persist saved deals and custom cards across sessions without a backend. |
| **LuffaTools DevTools** | Electron-based IDE for compiling, previewing, and debugging SuperBox miniapps on simulated and real devices. |

### Backend (Production Architecture)
| Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Node.js + Express** | REST API server. Lightweight, JavaScript-consistent with the frontend. |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database. Chosen for its strong consistency guarantees — important for loyalty point balances and deal claim counts. |
| **Sequelize ORM** | Database abstraction layer. Prevents SQL injection and simplifies migrations. |
| **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** | Stateless session tokens issued after Luffa wallet authentication. 7-day expiry. |
| **Luffa Wallet Auth** | Users authenticate via their Luffa wallet signature — no passwords stored anywhere in our system. |

## Architecture Flow
```
User opens miniapp
       │
       ▼
  wx.login() ──► Luffa auth server
                      │
                      ▼ wallet address
  POST /api/auth/login
       │
       ▼
  JWT issued ──► stored in miniapp
       │
       ▼
  wx.request() with JWT header
       │
  ┌────┴────┐
  │  Express  │
  │   API     │
  └────┬────┘
       │

  └─────────┘

## Security Model

- **No passwords.** Ever. The Luffa wallet signature is the identity.
- **No PII stored.** Users are identified only by wallet address.
- **JWT expiry.** Tokens expire in 7 days. Refresh flow in roadmap.
- **Parameterised queries.** All DB queries via Sequelize — no raw SQL from user input.
- **HTTPS only.** All `wx.request()` calls require HTTPS in production (Luffa enforces this).
